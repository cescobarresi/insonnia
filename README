==========
 Overview
==========

Insonnia is a software to wakeup and/or shutdown a list of machines by means of Wake On Lan.

Given a list of machine by CSV file, Insonnia will generate and send a Magic Packet to every machine or call shutdown.exe 
depending on the requested action.
It has been used on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008.

=======
 Build
=======

To build just issue the right Cargo command. On a linux machine: ::

    // Build for linux
    $ cargo build --release

    // Build for Windows
    $ cargo build --target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release

=======
Configuration
======
For the CSV file format refere to --help command. Insonnia ignores any
extra columns, but it will fail badly if a column is missing.

It will output to stdout some information when is run, and can log information
when a --log parameter is set. If the file exists it will append on every new run.
